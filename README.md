# MMazeBehavior_Analysis

This is an analysis tool that I wrote to read in data, plot it, and run statistical analysis for experiments that were run using the M-Maze tool. This code was written in Matlab. "ViewPTSD" is the primary user-facing script. It provides a GUI that you can use to navigate the data after loading it in. Any questions can be directed to David Pruitt.
